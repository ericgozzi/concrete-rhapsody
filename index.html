        <h1> Rhapsody in flexure, steel and concrete</h1>
        <p>
            The research on concrete as a study material arises from an interest 
            in its fluidity and viscosity, which, due to its particular composition, 
            manages to defy gravity solely through the obstacle it comes into contact with.
        </p>
        <p>
            The marriage between concrete and steel is re-considered, discovering new relationships
             and unconventional degrees of freedom. Following the gravitational pull, the different 
             materials influence each other, giving birth to a structure as the concrete weight bends 
             and stretches the reinforcements. The net is an obstacle to the concrete droplets: some can 
             filter through while others need to find alternative paths.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bending of the net and the weight of concrete generate spaces under which various
             human activities can take place while giving protection from the outer environment.
        </p>   
        <p>
            The act of pouring represents the generation of specific space, as from the moment the
             material is released, the space formation process begins solely through the force of gravity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study of the physical and mechanical properties of the materials allows a suitable
             translation to a technology and process so that an architectural space can emerge.
